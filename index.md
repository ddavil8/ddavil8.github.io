# Project with Purpose

## Intro

Hi and thank you for visiting my GitHub Page. At first, I did not know what I could do on my own with GitHub, but as I see my son's grades plummet, I realize that I have a very important project. Getting my son interested in school was a struggle even before COVID, but virtual learning made it way too easy for him to check out. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend to his needs since I was in the middle of getting my Bachelor's degree in Computer Information and Technologies during all of this uncertainty. Now that I have graduated and I am taking self-paced classes for my Master's degree in Data Analytics, I feel it's time to use my skills to help build a solid foundation for my son and anyone else's child that could benefit from these applications.

## Project Breakdown
1. Programmed Language: C# (console)
2. Environment: Visual Studios with Git linked to GitHub
3. Focus on one subject: Math
4. Zoom on specific subject concepts
5. Add encouragement despite incorrect selection
6. Create a database to track progression
7. Convert console to application
8. Design application to spark interest
